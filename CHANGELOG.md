## [2.0.0](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

#### Breaking
- Updated `AlphabeticCondition` and `AlphanumericCondition` to allow unicode characters by default (`NumericCondition` already allowed unicode characters by default).
    - Updated by [Aaron McTavish](https://github.com/aamctustwo) in Pull Request [#49](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/49).
- `AlphabeticCondition`, `AlphanumericCondition`, `CreditCardCondition`, `NumericCondition`, `PasswordStrengthCondition`, `PostcodeCondition`, and `RangeCondition` now store their configurations in a `configuration` property rather than as top-level properties of the condition's instance. As an example, for an instance of `AlphabeticCondition` the check `condition.allowsWhitespace == true` would become `condition.configuration.allowsWhitespace == true`.
    - Updated by [Aaron McTavish](https://github.com/aamctustwo) in Pull Request [#40](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/40) and [#41](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/41).

#### Added
- Added `Configuration`, `ConfigurableCondition`, `ConfigurableValidator` protocols. Updated existing conditions and validators to take advantage of new protocols.
    - Added by [Aaron McTavish](https://github.com/aamctustwo) in Pull Request [#40](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/40) and [#41](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/41).
- Added macOS support.
    - Added by [Aaron McTavish](https://github.com/aamctustwo) in Pull Request [#42](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/42).

#### Updated
- `NumericCondition` now supports ASCII only (as opposed to allowing any Unicode numeric characters) as an option. The default remains allowing Unicode characters.
    - Updated by [Aaron McTavish](https://github.com/aamctustwo) in Pull Request [#41](https://github.com/ustwo/formvalidator-swift/pull/41).
- The `shouldAllowViolation` property on validator controls now works as expected.
